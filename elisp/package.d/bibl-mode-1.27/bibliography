Name: The Devil's Dictionary
Keywords: humour, literature
Description: From the preface to the 1911 edition: ``The Devil's
    Dictionary was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, and was continued
    in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906.  In that year a
    large part of it was published in covers with the title The
    Cynic's Word Book, a name which the author had not the power to
    reject or happiness to approve.  To quote the publishers of the
    present work: "This more reverent title had previously been forced
    upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which
    a part of the work had appeared, with the natural consequence that
    when it came out in covers the country already had been flooded by
    its imitators with a score of 'cynic' books -- The Cynic's This,
    The Cynic's That, and The Cynic's t'Other. Most of these books
    were merely stupid, though some of them added the distinction of
    silliness.  Among them, they brought the word 'cynic' into
    disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in
    advance of publication."  Meantime, too, some of the enterprising
    humorists of the country had helped themselves to such parts of
    the work as served their needs, and many of its definitions,
    anecdotes, phrases and so forth, had become more or less current
    in popular speech.  This explanation is made, not with any pride
    of priority in trifles, but in simple denial of possible charges
    of plagiarism, which is no trifle.  In merely resuming his own the
    author hopes to be held guiltless by those to whom the work is
    addressed -- enlightened souls who prefer dry wines to sweet,
    sense to sentiment, wit to humor and clean English to slang.  A
    conspicuous, and it is hope not unpleasant, feature of the book is
    its abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets, chief of
    whom is that learned and ingenius cleric, Father Gassalasca Jape,
    S.J., whose lines bear his initials.  To Father Jape's kindly
    encouragement and assistance the author of the prose text is
    greatly indebted.''

        ... take the spices, honey, lemon juice (or white wine
    vinegar), tabasco sauce, and olive oil.  Mush 'em together (you
    don't need much; about two tablespoonsful all told) and coat the
    chicken breast in the mix.
        Superheat a frying pan.  Put the ring on full blast.  Go open
    all the windows and turn the extractor fan on full.  When the pan
    is *very* hot, pour a little oil on and throw the chicken on.
    There will be smoke all over the shop.  Keep turning the chicken,
    and pour on a little oil every so often, for one or two minutes.
    The outer flesh and spicy stuff should go black.
        Turn the ring down to normal frying temperature, and continue
    to fry for another five minutes or so.
        Spread some mayo on the warm toasty bread.  Put the lettuce
    on.  Throw your now-cooked chicken on, and pop the other half of
    the bread on top.  Eat.  Enjoy.

Description: Vibrant is a high-level, multi-platform user interface
    development library designed and implemented by Jonathan Kans at

    The philosophy behind Vibrant is that everything in the published
    user interface guidelines for the various windowing systems (i.e.,
    the generic behavior of windows, menus, buttons, etc., to which
    all programs should conform) is taken care of automatically,
    without needing attention from the programmer.

    your mailbox, and comes with a big set of bitmaps for most of the
    institutions on the net.  It can also display the name, or
    subject, or whatever, below the bitmaps.  It understands X-Face:
    headers.  And you can configure it to ignore certain messages, or
    to group certain messages together.  For example, I have it
    configured so that it displays all mail in certain categories
    (basically, one category for each mailing list that I'm on, plus a
    category for stuff from variants on "mailer-daemon") as a single
    icon, with the count of the number of messages in that category in

Description: Html-helper-mode makes it easier to edit HTML documents

    feature is that HTML tags are part of the mode: one simple
    keysequence will insert them for you. Alternately you can complete
    on a partial tag in the buffer. There's also support for
    indentation of nested lists, new buffer skeletons, timestamps,
    syntax colouring and various other useful things. See the WWW
    document for a full explanation.  Version 2.0 is the first
    official release after two beta tests. It is only slightly
    different from the last beta release, version 1.34.

    Real-time operating systems are described in terms of the
    primitives and constructs offered to application programs. In
    addition, the effects of underlying computer architectures on
    real-time operating systems are discussed, followed by a
    description of benchmarks and evaluation methods for real-time

    International Workshop on Memory Management.  (I would never say
    such a thing myself, but I'm told it's pretty good :-).  For one
    thing, it's got the first coherent discussion of various
    incremental techniques.
        `There's also a new, long version that I've submitted to
    Computing Surveys.  It's 60-odd pages of 2-up 10pt text, plus
    about 160 citations.  Even so, it doesn't cover parallel and
    distributed GC's.  (I think the discussion of incremental
    techniques lays the right groundwork for understanding distributed
    GC techniques, though.)'  See the readme file for more details.

    if you give a prefix argument the summary will also include
    inactive bug reports.  See also: GNATS.

    generously cut, so after their first washing will fit similarly to
    a polyester shirt of the same size. The available sizes are M, L,

    plus $1.14 sales tax). In quantities of ten or more, the price is

Name: rx -- regexp matcher
Keywords: regular expressions, C libraries
Description: An alternate implementation of a regexp matcher.  Tom
    Lord (the author) writes: Rx is at the stage of working well
    enough for performance tests, but it is not yet a full regex.c
    replacement.  The immediate plans for rx are to do the necessary
    work to replace regex.c.  Because of local drainbamage, ange-ftp
    won't work for that file.  Also, after logging as anonymous, you
    should cd to the rx directory in one step, not stopping in
    intermediate directories.  In that tar file, snapshot/README is
    the next thing to read.

Name: Es, the extensible shell
Keywords: sources, shells
Description: It's a shell.  Noah Friedman writes: Well, the difference
    is, most shells (zsh, bash, etc) have a million little kludges,
    and after all they they're still not very flexible.  They're big
    and bloated and slow.
    `es', on the other hand, has a cleaner syntax (it is very unlike
    sh).  The quoting rules are far less hairy.  And it's extremely
    flexible---even the top REPL can be replaced.  It's just a shell
    function.  (and while dynamic scope is still possible, the
    capability of lexical scope is an incredible win).
