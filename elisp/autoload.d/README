This directory probably ought to be renamed as "autoload" means
something slightly different to Emacs.

Files named xxxx-setup.el are automatically loaded after xxxx.el is
loaded.

Other files in this directory are on the back burner, awaiting use,
and should probably be moved to a backup directory.
