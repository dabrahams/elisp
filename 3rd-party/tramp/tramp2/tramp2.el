  SOURCE is the buffer that holds the data to be sent. This data
  *must not* be changed by this routine.

  START and END are positions in the SOURCE buffer. The data from
  START to END should be written to the remote file.

  FILE is the full tramp2 path of the file to write.

  If APPEND is non-nil, the data should be appended to the file,
  if it already exists. The file should be overwritten otherwise.

  This routine *must not* change the current buffer.


* `read', a function to read data from a file on the remote machine.
  It will be called in the connection buffer for a connection, with
  three arguments, START, END and FILE.

  START and END are byte positions in the remote file to be read.
  START and END may be nil, in which case the whole file should be read.

;;
;; * Populate `tramp2-connect-actors'. This needs:
;;   - (more) password prompt handling
;;   - login name handling (?)
;;   - tset/terminal type prompting
;;
;; * Progress messages need to be refined.
;;   - Work out what level various events sit at and define constants.

;;
;; * Better error handling.
;;   - Define a timeout error and a helper to throw one.
;;   - Throw human-readable error messages everywhere.
;;
;; * We should auto-load the encodings and so forth to avoid bloating
;;   the image.
;;
;; * Support for file-locking. This only requires the existence of
;;   symlink creation and testing predecates. We /should/ be able
;;   to do it. If not XEmacs (and Emacs if we have an enthusiast)
;;   should be patched to support it.
;;
;; * Get some python junky^W coder to write the Perl things in python
;;   as well. Maybe some other scripting languages, I don't know. The
;;   script-based stuff bits for performance, really, but it's better
;;   than lacking stat(2) on the remote machine. :)

;;   - on a per-protocol basis, as a hook. Implement some generic support for
