Changes from 1.25 to 1.27

Mousing an entry in a names/keywords buffer now searches repeatedly
through the bibliography buffer, rather than from the top.

Byte compilation problems fixed.

Calling external browsers now works properly.  Incidentally, here is
the method I use to access URLs (I run Kyle Jones' VM mailer; see the
`bibliography' file in this distribution for a pointer):
  (setq bibl-web-interface (if window-system
			       'vm-mouse-send-url-to-netscape
			     'w3-fetch))
  (autoload 'w3-fetch "w3" "Autoload w3." t)
  (autoload 'vm-mouse-send-url-to-netscape "vm" "Mouse with View Mail." t)
This has the useful property that if I am running under a window
system and already have a Netscape process running, that Netscape is
used when I want to go to a record.  Win, win.

Changes from 1.23e to 1.25

The Perl scripts for displaying a bibliography file on the Web have
been certified healthy.

The bibl2html script now needs Perl 5 to run.  Tweaking it to run
under Perl 4 should not be hard, however.

Records beginning with unwanted words such as `an' or `the' are now
sorted according to the second word on their titles rather than the
first.

Changes from 1.23e to 2.0

Spiffy new HTML conversion code now provides clickable forms instead
of the old lame lists.  Adapted from code written by Andrew Condon.

You can now access local files using `file' URLs by leaving off the
leading `//' in the URL.

Changes from 1.23 to 1.23e

Further bug fixes.

TeXinfo documentation has been written.  This file has been created.

This package now works *correctly* (it used to half work) if you're
not running Emacs under a window system.

The bibliography file header is no longer visible in Emacs windows.

Bibl-sort-buffer will now sort by keyword too.  The sort isn't stable,
though.
