@unnumbered GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
@center Version 2, June 1991

@display
Copyright @copyright{} 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
@end display

@unnumberedsec Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@iftex
@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

@iftex
@heading NO WARRANTY
@end iftex

PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU@.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

@unnumberedsec How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) 19@var{yy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE@.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@var{yy} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@smallexample
@group
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written 
by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end group
@end smallexample

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

@node Introduction, Starting Up, License, Top
@unnumbered Introduction

Bibliography mode (bibl-mode) is a subsystem of GNU Emacs which allows
you to keep track of information on the World Wide Web and elsewhere.
It is primarily intended for storing information about software
packages, Web pages, mailing lists, and other data of interest to users
of the Internet, but can also be used to keep references to books and
papers, and can be extended to hold a heterogeneous database of most any
sort of textual information.

Commands are provided to simplify the task of creating and maintaining
records in the database, to access information over the Web, and to move
easily through medium-sized databases.  Other commands exist which allow
information to be grabbed from mail and news articles, and to allow
records to be pasted into other buffers.

Bibl-mode is an attempt on my part to speed up the process of adding to
and searching through databases without going to @emph{too} great an
effort in this direction.  However, if you can think of any features
which could do with improving, or any useful features which are missing
entirely, please get in touch with me.

@end menu

The latest version of bibl-mode may always be picked up via anonymous
ftp from @t{ftp.maths.tcd.ie:pub/bosullvn/elisp/bibl-mode.tar.gz}.

@node Background, Reporting Problems, Introduction, Introduction
@section Background and Motivation

I picked up the notion of using a bibliography file while working for a
time with Jim Blandy @t{<jimb@@cyclic.com>}, and have found it so useful
that I finally sat down to write some non-trivial support for it.  I
find this package to be useful too, so my time may not have been wasted
(more to the point, I can now waste my time with greater efficiency).

My bibliography file consists of all kinds of random pieces of
information: I keep in it pointers to useful sites on the net, books
that are worth reading, and various other things.  The main use for this
package is for keeping track of all these data, and thereby attempting
to address the one problem that no software systems currently seem to
attack.

The Internet quite probably has available whatever information it is you
want on a subject somewhere, but you will have trouble finding it (yes,
there are Archie, FAQs, and Web pointer sites, but the problem still
exists).  What I usually do, upon seeing a posting or receiving a piece
of email pertaining to some subject which interests me, or upon finding
an interesting page on the Web, is create a bibliography entry for it,
with (if possible) a Universal Record Locator (URL) pointing to whatever
it may be.  This can be invaluable for future references.

@node Reporting Problems, Acknowledgments, Background, Introduction
@section Reporting Problems

@findex bibl-submit-bug-report
@kindex C-c C-r
If you encounter a bug while using bibl-mode, @emph{please} use
@code{bibl-submit-bug-report} when submitting a bug report (you can get
at this using @kbd{C-c C-r} from a bibl-mode buffer).

In addition, @emph{please} be concise in your description of the
problem, @emph{and} try to put together some sort of test case which
will allow me to reproduce the problem with a minimum of effort.  The
more information you can provide, the greater the speed with which I can
provide a fix for the problem @xref{Bugs, , Reporting Bugs, emacs, the
GNU Emacs Manual}.

@subsection The Mailing List

If you find yourself using this package much, you may wish to join its
associated mailing and discussion list, @t{<info-bibl@serpentine.com>}.
Send mail to @t{<info-bibl-request@serpentine.com>} with a message body
of `subscribe info-bibl'.

If you are just sending in a suggestion or a question, then I probably
don't need all the extra baggage that gets carried in a bug report
message.  Also, the extra gumph may annoy other people on the mailing
list, so please be careful.

@node Starting Up, Browsing Records, Introduction, Top
@chapter Starting Up

Before you start using bibliography mode, you may have to set a few
variables in your @file{~/.emacs} file.

@menu
* Global Keymap::               Globally defining keys for entering bibl-mode.
* Primary Database::            Setting the name of the main bibliography file.
* Web Interface::               Defining the interface to use to the Web.
* Emacs Interface::             Using Emacs facilities to access the Web.
@end menu

Once this is done, typing @kbd{M-x bibl-visit-bibliography} (or
@kbd{C-c b v} if you have done the keymap binding) should get you into
a bibliography file.

@findex bibl-mode
Should you open a file which seems to be a valid bibliography file but
bibl-mode is not entered correctly (a short header should be visible at
the top of the file), try typing @kbd{M-x bibl-mode}.  This probably
won't work if Emacs hasn't automatically put the buffer in bibl-mode
(since it @emph{should} do so), but it might be worth a try.

@vindex bibl-mode-hooks
The value of the variable @code{bibl-mode-hooks} is run when a buffer
enters bibl-mode (i.e. by any of the file visiting commands @xref{Global
Keymap}.

@node Global Keymap, Primary Database, Starting Up, Starting Up
@section Global Key Bindings

@vindex bibl-global-map
Use something like @code{(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'bibl-global-map)} to
define a prefix binding for bibliography file visiting commands.

@vindex bibl-prompt-on-visit
If @code{bibl-prompt-on-visit} is non-@code{nil}, you are prompted for
the name of the file to visit by all of bibl-mode's file visiting
commands (and a few others).

The above definition gives you the following key bindings:

@vindex bibl-file-name
Under most circumstances, you should only need a single bibliography
file in which to keep all your information.  The name of this file
should be given by the variable @code{bibl-file-name}, which you can set
in your @file{~/.emacs} file with something like @code{(setq
bibl-file-name "~/etc/bibliography")}.

@vindex bibl-use-any-buffer
@vindex bibl-cache-keys
Should you @emph{not} wish to just use a single bibliography file, make
sure that the values of @code{bibl-prompt-on-visit} and
@code{bibl-use-any-buffer} are non-@code{nil}, and that
@code{bibl-cache-keys} is set to @code{nil}.  This may slow down the
popping up of record name and keyword list buffers @xref{Listing
Information}.

@node Web Interface, Emacs Interface, Primary Database, Starting Up
@section The Web Interface

@vindex bibl-web-interface
The value of variable @code{bibl-web-interface} determines the method
that will be used to access information over the World Wide Web.

If set to a string (for example @file{TkWWW %s &}), bibl-mode runs the
given command, expanding instances of the @file{%s} string into the URL
to be accessed.  In this way, you can use your favourite Web browser or
a command of your choice to access data over the Web.

If @code{bibl-web-interface} is set to a symbol (for example
@code{'w3-fetch}), bibl-mode attempts to call the function of the same
name.  It passes the function a single argument, which is a string
containing the URL to access.  In this way, you can either write your
own Emacs Lisp code to do the work, or use an existing Emacs package
such as William Perry's (@code{<wmperry@@indiana.edu>}) @code{w3}
browser, or Mike Walker's (@code{<M.D.Walker@@larc.nasa.gov>})
@code{mrc-lib} for `remote controlling' NCSA Mosaic.

@subsection Esoterica

@vindex bibl-user-name
If you decide to use Emacs' built-in remote file access, you may wish to
check to see that the value of @code{bibl-user-name} is set correctly.
This variable is used as the password for internal anonymous ftp.

@vindex bibl-default-user
You may also wish to change the value of @code{bibl-default-user}.  This
variable is the default login name that will be used for internal ftp;
it defaults to @code{anonymous}.  The value of this variable overrides
the value of @code{ange-ftp-default-user}.  Note that the behaviour of
this variable may change slightly once @code{efs}, the replacement for
@code{ange-ftp}, is released.

@node Emacs Interface,  , Web Interface, Starting Up
@section Emacs and the Web

Emacs 19 comes with standard facilities to allow remote file access and
remote login.  Since these are so useful, bibl-mode provides a way to
use them directly, rather than the Web interface you choose @xref{Web
Interface}.

@vindex bibl-use-elisp
This behaviour is governed by the value of the @code{bibl-use-elisp}
variable.  By default, it is set to @code{'both}, which means that
bibl-mode uses the internal Emacs facilities to perform remote accesses
when a URL you want to access @xref{Accessing Records} is of type
@file{file} or @file{telnet}.

If you set @code{bibl-use-elisp} to @code{'efs}, only remote file access
is done through standard Emacs facilities; all other types of Web
accesses use the Web interface you have chosen @xref{Web Interface}.  If
you set to @code{'telnet}, only remote login is performed using Emacs
facilities.

Typing @kbd{C-c C-n} (@code{bibl-list-names}) pops up a second buffer,
which contains an alphabetically sorted list of the names of all records
in the bibl-mode buffer.

@findex bibl-list-keywords
@kindex C-c C-k
Hitting @kbd{C-c C-k} (@code{bibl-list-keywords}) performs the same

bibl-mode buffer.

@node Names Mode Buffers, Going to Records, Listing Information, Browsing Records
@section Names Mode Buffers

@findex bibl-names-mode
Buffers which contain lists of either record names or keywords are in

@table @key
@end ifinfo
@findex bibl-names-find-resource
@kindex SPC

You can jump to a particular named record at any time in a bibl-mode
buffer by typing @kbd{C-c C-o} (@code{bibl-goto-record}).  This will
bring up a minibuffer prompt which asks you which record you wish to
jump to; you can perform completion on a record name while you type by
hitting @key{TAB}.

@node Accessing Records, Electronic Mail, Going to Records, Browsing Records
@section Accessing Resources on the Web

@findex bibl-find-resource
@kindex C-c C-f
Typing @kbd{C-c C-f} (@code{bibl-find-resource}) in a bibl-mode buffer
attempts to fetch the Web resource listed under the @samp{Location}
field of the current record.  If more than one such field exists in a
record, you are prompted for the one to fetch.

When you attempt to fetch a resource, bibl-mode will use the value of
@code{bibl-web-interface} and @code{bibl-use-elisp} to determine what
action to take @xref{Web Interface}.

@vindex bibl-find-resource-edit
By default, bibl-mode will allow you to edit the URL you have selected
before it tries to fetch it.  If you wish, you can disable this feature
by setting @code{bibl-find-resource-edit} to @code{nil} in your
@file{~/.emacs} file @xref{Web Interface}.

@vindex bibl-use-elisp
If the URL you attempt to access is of type @code{file} and
@emph{doesn't} have a leading @code{//} string, it is automatically
passed to Emacs' file-finding code, regardless of the value of
@code{bibl-use-elisp}.  This permits you to use local file names in
@code{Location} fields as well as remote ones.

@section Creating a New Record

@findex bibl-create-record
@kindex C-c C-c
Typing @kbd{C-c C-c} (@code{bibl-create-record}) creates a new record
template at the top of a bibl-mode buffer.  You can move down through
this template manually and add information to each field as necessary.
Note that the @samp{Record} field is already filled out when you type
@kbd{C-c C-c}; you should not change this line manually.

When you are done filling out a record template, you can clear away
unused fields @xref{Tidying Records}.

@vindex bibl-record-fields
@vindex bibl-custom-record-fields
The default list of fields which are inserted into a buffer when you
type @kbd{C-c C-c} are given in @code{bibl-record-fields}.  You can add
to the list of fields used by making a list of your own in the variable
@code{bibl-custom-record-fields}.

@findex bibl-update-record-fields
Should you decide to extend the list of fields in a record template in
this manner, be sure to run @kbd{M-x bibl-update-record-fields}
afterwards, so that bibl-mode will correctly `see' the changes you have
made.

@node Tidying Records, Extending Records, Creating Records, Editing Records
@section Tidying a Record

@findex bibl-tidy-record
@kindex C-c C-t
Once you have filled out all the fields you wish to in a record
template, type @kbd{C-c C-t} to `tidy away' those fields which remain
empty.

@vindex bibl-dont-fill
The key bindings for the following two functions can be turned off
@emph{before} you load bibl-mode by setting the value of
@code{bibl-dont-fill} to @code{t}.

@findex bibl-indent-line
@kindex TAB
@vindex bibl-indentation
Hitting @kbd{TAB} will indent the current line correctly.

@findex bibl-fill-paragraph
@kindex M-C-q
You can reformat the current paragraph by typing @kbd{M-C-q}.  The
@emph{current paragraph} for our purposes is the area around point,
demarcated by empty or header lines.

@node Extending Records, Updating Records, Tidying Records, Editing Records
@section Extending a Record

@findex bibl-extend-record
@kindex C-c C-x
You may sometimes wish to add another field to an already extant record.
The easiest way to do this is to type @kbd{C-c C-x}
(@code{bibl-extend-record}), which will prompt you for the field you
wish to add (with completion), and insert it at the bottom of the
current record.

The possible fields that may be added to a record are drawn from the
default list of fields plus any extra ones you may have specified
@xref{Creating Records}.

@node Updating Records, Sorting Buffers, Extending Records, Editing Records
@section Updating a Record

@findex bibl-update-record
@kindex C-c C-u
If you edit or change a record at some stage, you may wish to keep track
of when you last changed it.  This date can eaily be updated by typing
@kbd{C-c C-u} (@code{bibl-update-record}).  The @emph{creation date} of
the record (in the @samp{Record} field) is not affected by this.

@node Sorting Buffers, Marking and Deleting, Updating Records, Editing Records
@section Sorting a Buffer

@findex bibl-sort-buffer
@kindex C-c C-b
The key sequence @kbd{C-c C-b} (@code{bibl-sort-buffer}) will sort all
records in the current buffer alphabetically, by the @samp{Name} field
of each.

@kindex C-u C-c C-b
You can also sort records in a buffer alphabetically by keyword by
calling this function with a prefix argument (@kbd{C-u C-c C-b}).

@node Marking and Deleting,  , Sorting Buffers, Editing Records
@section Marking and Deleting Records

@findex bibl-delete-record
@kindex C-c C-d
Typing @kbd{C-c C-d} (@code{bibl-delete-record}) deletes the record at
point.

@findex bibl-mark-record
@kindex C-c C-m
If you type @kbd{C-c C-m} (@code{bibl-mark-record}), mark is set to the
beginning of the current record, and point is put at its end.  This
makes life easier for use with commands such as @kbd{M-w}
(@code{kill-ring-save}), so you can pop bibliography records into email
and such with greater speed @xref{The Kill Ring, , Yanking, emacs, the
GNU Emacs Manual}.

@node Grabbing Records, Mouse Support, Editing Records, Top
@chapter Grabbing Information from Mail and News Buffers

Typing @kbd{C-c b g} (@code{bibl-visit-grab}) fetches as much
information as possible from the current buffer and visits your
bibliography file.  Once there, it creates a new record template and
fills it out from the information found in the previous buffer.

If you call this function from a mail or news buffer, it will attempt to
grab useful information from the current message's headers.  The mail
and news packages currently supported are VM, mh-e, and GNUS.

In addition to grabbing information from mail headers,
@code{bibl-visit-grab} will also grab bibliography record information
which is embedded in a mail message or news article, even if it has been
tabbed in or each line preceded by Lisp-style comments.

@kindex C-u C-c b g
By default, @code{bibl-visit-grab} works from the top of the current
buffer.  Calling it with a prefix argument (@kbd{C-u C-c b g}) causes
the search for information to go from point instead.

@section Caveats

Please note that the code which performs the grabbing work is @emph{not}
very intelligent (specifically, it can currently only cope with
one-liner @samp{Description} lines in embedded bibliography records, and
will only grab one of any field type).  However, it does the job pretty
well most of the time.
